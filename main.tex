\chapter*{Introduction}
Greetings, inquiring minds!

Welcome to this journey through the fascinating world of deep learning. We are Federico and Jacopo, two students like you who decided to put on paper (or rather, pixels on screen) our knowledge acquired during the Deep Learning course taught by Professor Elisa Ricci at the University of Trento.

First of all, a clarification: we are not professionals in the field, but simply two enthusiasts who decided to share their learning journey. These handouts are born out of a desire to help other students like us to tackle the study of Deep Learning.

The content of this book is based primarily on Professor Ricci's course, but we have also drawn from various other sources. For example, we have been inspired by 3Blue1Brown videos (which saved our lives in understanding backpropagation), scientific papers, and specialized websites. Whenever we have been inspired by an outside source, you will find the appropriate link in the text.

A special feature of this book are the illustrations: they are all done using TikZ library. We know that graphics can make all the difference in understanding complex concepts, so we paid special attention to this aspect.

Now, let's talk about you! This project was created for students and is open to students. If you would like to contribute, improve the LaTeX code or report any errors, you can do so on our \href{https://github.com/federicobrancasi/Deep-Learning}{GitHub repository} (click on it to open the link). Your pull requests are more than welcome, whether they are corrections to the text or improvements to the illustrations.

We know that Deep Learning can seem like a tough subject at first. That is precisely why we have tried to go into detail on each topic, breaking down complex concepts into more digestible parts. Our goal is that, at the end of this book, you will be able to say, "\textit{Hey, that wasn't so hard!}"

It's worth mentioning that this book was created using a modified version of the LatHex Forta template. We adapted it to fit our specific needs. If you're interested in the original template, you can find it here: \href{https://github.com/apehex/lathex-template}{LatHex}. 


That said, all that remains is for us to wish you good study! Remember: learning is a process, not a destination. 

Have a safe journey!

\hfill Federico and Jacopo

And here we are, at the end of this journey into the world of Deep Learning. If you have made it this far, congratulations! You have just completed no small feat.

Remember when we started, talking about neurons and activation functions? It seems like an eternity ago, doesn't it? Since then, we have been exploring increasingly complex neural networks, taming gradients, training models, and maybe even dreaming tensors at night.

We hope this book has not only taught you the fundamentals but also ignited a passion for Deep Learning. The challenges ahead are complex, but so are the potential rewards. You have the power to shape the future of technology and positively impact society.

Thank you for joining us on this journey.
Good luck and happy innovating!

\hfill Federico and Jacopo
