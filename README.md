# Deep Learning Book

## Overview

Welcome to the repository of our comprehensive Deep Learning book! This work is the culmination of our journey through the fascinating world of neural networks, inspired by the Deep Learning course taught by Professor Elisa Ricci at the University of Trento.
Our goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications in the field of Deep Learning. Whether you're a student, researcher, or AI enthusiast, this book offers a deep dive into the core principles and cutting-edge techniques that power modern AI systems.

## TikZ Illustrations

One of the unique features of this book is our extensive use of TikZ for creating high-quality illustrations. TikZ, a powerful package for creating graphics in LaTeX, has allowed us to craft clear, elegant diagrams that enhance understanding of complex concepts.
In the [TikZ folder](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/Deep-Learning/tree/main/tikz), you'll find the source code for all our illustrations. We encourage you to explore, use, and even improve upon these diagrams. Whether you're learning TikZ or looking for inspiration for your own Deep Learning visualizations, this collection serves as a valuable resource.

## How to Contribute
